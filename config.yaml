      **Where I'm From:**
      
      I was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I am proud to call it my home. I have benefitted enormously from the Cincinnati community 
      and their public school system, without which I wouldn't be where I am today. Cincy is my favorite place in the world - the people
      are so nice, the valley is beautiful, and I get to see my cat whenever I visit! 

      **What I Do:**

      I am a computer engineering student at UPenn interested in chip design and computer systems. My coursework has been split
      between hardware and software, and I love working in the intersections between the two (although I am a little scarred by embedded systems). 
      While there are many late nights hunched over a lab table or scanning through waveforms, it is always worth it when I get to see
      my creations come to life.

      I am currently working full-time under Professors Jinf Li and Andre DeHon in their [CyberSavvy Lab](https://cybersavvy.seas.upenn.edu/), 
      where I am setting up cloud communication between our FPGAs using Docker and Kubernetes.

          I hold events for my residents every month under a strict budget. I am also "on call" for several days in the semester - basically, if anything happens
          I am called in to document the event and report it to my supervisor. Very eventful!
