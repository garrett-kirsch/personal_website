      **Where I'm From:**

      I was raised around Cincinnati, Ohio, and I am proud to call it my home. Cincinnati is my favorite place in the 
      world, and every time I get to go back there is a treat for me (especially because I get to see my cat). I am also a 
      die-hard Bengals fan, in that I die every time we start the season with 3 straight losses. I have benefitted immensely
      from the Cincinnati community and public school system, and I hope to give back to that wonderful city for the 
      amazing upbringing it gave me.

      **What I Do:**

      I am a computer engineering student at UPenn interested in chip design and computer systems. My coursework has been split
      between hardware and software, and I love working in the intersections between the two. My favorite
      classes so far have been Compture Organization and Design (CIS 4710), Fundamentals of Solid State Circuits (ESE 3190), and Digital Circuit Modeling (ESE 3700).

      I am currently working full-time under Professors Jinf Li and Andre DeHon in their [CyberSavvy Lab](https://cybersavvy.seas.upenn.edu/), where I am setting up cloud communication
      between our FPGAs using Docker and Kubernetes.

          I hold events for my  residents every month under a strict budget. I am also "on call" for several days in the semester - basically, if anything happens
          I am called in to document the event and report it to my supervisor. Very eventful!
